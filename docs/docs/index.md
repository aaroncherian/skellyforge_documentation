## <b> SkellyForge Documentation </b>

SkellyForge is an open-source software designed for post-processing of 3D motion-capture data generated by FreeMoCap. While FreeMoCap has its own post-processing features, SkellyForge offers a more detailed exploration and fine-tuning of this process.

Through SkellyForge, users can better understand and adjust how interpolation, filtering, and rotation affect their data. The software allows for parameter modifications and side-by-side comparison of raw and post-processed 3D data. It also provides the ability to view and adjust the X, Y, and Z trajectories of the data, giving a clear view of the effect of post-processing on individual traces.

## <b> Installation </b>

SkellyForge can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install skellyforge
```

To start SkellyForge, run the following command:

``` bash
python -m skellyforge
```

When prompted, input the path to a completed FreeMoCap recording folder (no quotation marks required around the path). This will launch the SkellyForge GUI.
